`atlasclient` and also contains the test harnesses necessary to run
Atlas Planned Maintenance specification tests.

## Linting and Formatting

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) for
managing linting. `pre-commit` performs various checks on the files and
uses tools that help follow a consistent style within the repo.

To set up `pre-commit` locally, run:

``` bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

To run `pre-commit` manually, run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

To run a manual hook like `shellcheck` manually, run:

``` bash
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual shellcheck
```
