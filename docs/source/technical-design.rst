Abstract
--------

Testing drivers against Atlas clusters undergoing maintenance is required to increase the likelihood that deviations
of driver behavior from the high-availability and/or graceful-failure characteristics promised by `driver
specifications <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications>`_ are detected and rectified during development.
This specification outlines a testing framework that streamlines the process of testing drivers against Atlas clusters
undergoing maintenance thereby ensuring expeditious incorporation of this additional testing into all driver projects.
The improved test coverage will result in a superior user experience as workload disruption during planned maintenance
due to undiscovered bugs in the drivers, server or Atlas will become less likely.

---------------------
Architecture Overview
---------------------

To ensure maintainability and extensibility, the Atlas Planned Maintenance Testing Framework has a modular design
comprised of the following components:

#. Test Scenario Format: the test format creates a standard language for describing Atlas Planned Maintenance Tests.
#. Workload Executor: a user-implemented, driver-specific script with a standard command-line API that translates driver
   workloads described in the test scenario format into driver operations that are run against the test cluster.
#. Test Orchestrator: a command-line utility that accepts Workload Executor and test specification in the
   Test Scenario Format and runs an Atlas Planned Maintenance Test. The Test Orchestrator is also responsible for
   leveraging the Atlas API to provision, configure, and monitor Atlas clusters.

   Schematic representation of the test framework architecture.

The subsequent sections describe each of these components in greater detail and are intended as a reference for
implementation of the testing framework described in this specification. Drivers MUST integrate this testing framework
into their continuous integration workflow - see the :ref:`integration-guide` for instructions.

--------------------
Test Scenario Format

Workload Executor

-----------------
Test Orchestrator
-----------------

.. attention:: ``astrolabe`` is the reference implementation of the Test Orchestrator design described in this section.
   As ``astrolabe`` evolves to better serve the testing objectives of MongoDB Drivers and MongoDB Atlas, this section
   is likely to become outdated. Instead, readers are encouraged to study ``astrolabe``'s documentation and source
   code to gain an up-to-date understanding of the Test Orchestrator's implementation.

The Test Orchestrator is a command-line utility that ingests a Atlas Planned Maintenance Test specified in the
Test Scenario Format and leverages the Atlas API and a user-supplied Workload Executor to run the test on a live
Atlas Cluster.

Features
--------

The Test Orchestrator MUST support the following, low-level operations via the MongoDB Atlas API:

#. Creating a new Atlas Cluster with the given Cluster Configuration Options [#f2]_.
#. Adding a given IP address to the IP whitelist of an Atlas Project [#f6]_.
#. Creating a new database user with the given name and password on an Atlas Cluster [#f7]_.
#. Modifying the Cluster Configuration Options of a given, already running Atlas Cluster [#f3]_, [#f4]_.
#. Retrieving the server logs from all hosts in an Atlas Cluster [#f8]_.
#. Retrieving the Cluster State of a given Atlas Cluster.

To prevent leaking MongoDB Atlas API credentials from the test machines, the Test Orchestrator MUST support
the specification of API credentials via environment variables.

User-Facing API
---------------

The Test Orchestrator MUST be an executable that supports the following invocation pattern::

	./test-orchestrator spec-tests run-one path/to/workload-spec.yml -e path/to/workload-executor

where:

* ``test-orchestrator`` is the Test Orchestrator executable,
* ``spec-tests run-one`` is the name of the command issued to this executable,
* ``path/to/workload-spec.yml`` is the path to a test scenario file,
* ``-e`` is a flag indicating that the following argument is the workload executor binary, and
* ``path/to/workload-executor`` is the path to the workload executor binary that is to be used to run the Driver Workload.

Pseudocode Implementation
-------------------------

The pseudocode implementation in this section is provided for illustrative purposes only. For the sake of simplicity,
all interaction with the Atlas API in this sample implementation is handled by the ``AtlasController`` class which
implements the following interface::

    interface AtlasController {
        # Creates a new Atlas cluster from the "initial" Cluster Configuration Options of the given maintenanceScenario.
        # Returns the cluster's connection string.
        public createNewCluster(maintenanceScenario: object): string;

        # Initiates application of the "final" Cluster Configuration Options of the given maintenanceScenario.
        public triggerMaintenance(maintenanceScenario: object): void;

        # Blocks until the Cluster State becomes IDLE. Implementations MUST poll the API to monitor the Cluster State.
        # Implementations MUST account for rate limits on Atlas API resources and retry requests that fail
        # with a "429 Too Many Requests" response code.
        public waitUntilClusterIdle(): void;

        # Fetches the server (mongod & mongos) logs from the Atlas Cluster nodes and writes them to disk.
        public writeServerLogs(): void;
    }

Then, the Test Orchestrator can be implemented as follows::

    # Import the atlas controller.
    import { AtlasAPI } from "atlasController"

    # The testOrchestrator function accepts the path to a scenario YAML file
    # and the path to the workload executor executable. This function will be invoked with arguments
    # parsed from the command-line invocation of the test orchestrator binary.
    function testOrchestrator(scenarioFile: string, workloadExecutorPath: string): void {

        # Initialize Atlas controller.
        const atlasController = AtlasController();

        # Parse the maintenance scenario and the driver workload from the file.
        maintenanceScenario, driverWorkload = parseScenario(scenarioFile);

        # Create a cluster and wait for it to be ready for running operations.
        connectionString = atlasController.createNewCluster(maintenanceScenario);
        atlasController.waitUntilClusterIdle();

        # Initiate the driver workload in a subprocess.
        workloadSubprocess = spawnProcess([workloadExecutorPath, connectionString, driverWorkload]);

        # Implement maintenance plan and wait for completion.
        atlasController.triggerMaintenance(maintenanceScenario);
        atlasController.waitUntilClusterIdle();

        # Send a SIGINT to the workload executor to terminate workloads that run indefinitely.
        workloadSubprocess.send(SIGINT);

        # Write the contents of the workload executor's standard streams (stdout and stderr) to file for debugging use.
        writeWorkloadExecutorLogs(workloadSubprocess)

        # Fetch Atlas logs and write them to disk.
        atlasController.writeServerLogs();

        # The test orchestrator SHOULD output one test result file per scenario file in the standard
        # XUnit XML Format. This will enable the elegant test status console on Evergreen.
        # The XUnit output MAY use the workload statistics returned by the executor to make this output more informative.
        writeJUnitEntry(workloadSubprocess);

        # The test orchestrator sets the same exit-code as the workload executor to indicate test success/failure.
        process.exit(workloadSubprocess.exitCode);
    }
