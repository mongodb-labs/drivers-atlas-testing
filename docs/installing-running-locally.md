# Installing and Running Locally

Installing and running `astrolabe` is useful when writing integrations
for new drivers (see [integration-guide](./integration-guide.md)) and when debugging issues
uncovered by testing. This document walks through the steps needed to
install `astrolabe` on your local machine and use it to run Atlas and
Kubernetes test scenarios.

## Platform Support

`astrolabe` runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.

Running `astrolabe` requires Python 3.9 or later. To check the version
of Python you are running, do:

``` bash
python --version
```

## Installation

`astrolabe` can be installed from sources using `pip`:

``` bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/mongodb-labs/drivers-atlas-testing.git
```

Once installed, check that your installation is working:

``` bash
astrolabe --version
```

You can use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to
isolate your `astrolabe` installation from other Python applications on
your system. To do so, run:

``` bash
python -m virtualenv my_virtualenv && source my_virtualenv/bin/activate
```

before running the command to install `astrolabe`. Note that the `bin`
directory will be called `Scripts` on Windows systems.


## Exploring the API

With the Atlas API credentials now configured, you are ready to use
`astrolabe`. Exploring `astrolabe`'s capabilities is very easy due to
its self-documenting command-line interface. To see a list of available
commands, run:

``` bash
astrolabe --help
```

Say, for instance, that you would like to use `astrolabe` to create a
cluster. Looking at the output of the `astrolabe --help` command, you
realize that the `clusters` command group probably has what you are
looking for. You can explore the usage of this command group by running:

``` bash
astrolabe clusters --help
```

Sure enough, the command group has the `create-dedicated` command that
does what you want to do. Command usage can be understood by employing a
familiar pattern:

``` bash
astrolabe clusters create-dedicated --help
```

## Debugging

Astrolabe comes with built-in logging functionality that can be
customized using the `--log-level` option. Supported logging levels, in
decreasing order of verbosity are:

- `DEBUG`
- `INFO` (the default)
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `CRITICAL`

For example, to use the `DEBUG` logging level, do:

``` bash
astrolabe --log-level DEBUG <command> [COMMAND OPTIONS]
```

# Running Atlas Planned Maintenance Tests

Follow these instructions to run an Atlas Planned Maintenance (APM)
test.

## Configuration

Before you can start using `astrolabe` to run Atlas planned maintenance
tests, you must configure it to give it access to the MongoDB Atlas API.

If you haven't done so already, create a [MongoDB Atlas
Organization](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/organizations-projects)
(this can only be done via the Atlas UI). Make a note of the name of the
Atlas organization.

Depending on the test scenario being executed, you will need either one
or two sets of a [Programmatic API
Keys](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/): a regular
key for Atlas Organization you created with "Organization Owner"
permissions, and potentially a key with Atlas Global Operator
permissions (hereafter referred to as the "admin key"). The admin key
generally must be created by a Cloud team member and would typically be
issued for the development environment of Atlas
(<https://cloud-dev.mongodb.com>), meaning the organization and projects
must also be created in the development environment.

Each API key consists of 2 parts - a public key and a private key.

To configure `astrolabe` to use production Atlas and specify only a
regular API key, declare the following variables:

``` bash
export ATLAS_ORGANIZATION_ID=<Atlas Organization Id>
export ATLAS_API_USERNAME=<API Public Key>
export ATLAS_API_PASSWORD=<API Private Key>
```

To configure `astrolabe` to use development Atlas and specify two sets
of API keys, declare the following variables:

``` bash
export ATLAS_ORGANIZATION_ID=<Atlas Organization Id>
export ATLAS_API_USERNAME=<API Public Key>
export ATLAS_API_PASSWORD=<API Private Key>
export ATLAS_ADMIN_API_USERNAME=<Admin API Public Key>
export ATLAS_ADMIN_API_PASSWORD=<Admin API Private Key>
export ATLAS_API_BASE_URL=https://cloud-dev.mongodb.com/api/atlas
```

Finally, use the `check-connection` command to confirm that `astrolabe`
is able to connect to and authenticate with the Atlas API:

``` bash
astrolabe check-connection
```

If you encounter an `AtlasAuthenticationError` when running
`check-connection`, it means that configuration was unsuccessful.

## Running Tests

The `atlas-tests` command-group is used for Atlas Planned Maintenance
(APM) tests. To run a single APM test, do:

``` bash
astrolabe atlas-tests \
    run-one <path/to/test-file.yml> \
    --workload-file <path/to/workload-file.yml> \
    --workload-executor <path/to/workload-executor> \
    --project-name <atlasProjectName> \
    --cluster-name-salt <randomString>
```

where:

- `<path/to/test-file.yml>` is the absolute or relative path to a test
  scenario file in the `atlas-test-scenario` format,
- `<path/to/workload-file.yml>` is the absolute or relative path to a
  workload file in the `kubernetes-test-scenario` format,
- `<path/to/workload-executor>` is the absolute or relative path to the
  workload executor of the driver to be tested,
- `<atlasProjectName>` is the name of the Atlas Project under which the
  test cluster used for the test will be created,
- `<randomString>` is a string that is used as salt while generating the
  randomized character string that will be used as the name of the test
  cluster.


If an Atlas Project of the specified name does not already exist,
`astrolabe` will create one.

Cluster name generation uses the name of the test scenario file along
with the value of `--cluster-name-salt` to generate a randomized
character string that is used as the name of the cluster created for the
purposes of running the test. A deterministic hashing algorithm is
employed to generate cluster names so using the same
`--cluster-name-salt` value with a given test file will produce the same
cluster name each time.

A common use-case when using `astrolabe` is to run a given test several
times, in quick succession. This is necessary during test failure
debugging and testing workload executor implementations. By default,
`astrolabe` automatically deletes a cluster at the end of a test run
(this helps keep cloud hosting costs low by minimizing Atlas cluster
uptime). This is quite inconvenient when the test needs to be run
multiple times in succession as cluster creation is very time consuming
and can take up to 10 minutes. To ameliorate the situation, the
`run-one` command supports a `--no-delete` flag that prevents the
deletion of the cluster at the end of a test run:

``` bash
astrolabe atlas-tests run-one ... --no-delete
```

Using this flag with a given test file and static `--cluster-name-salt`
value helps significantly reduce waiting times between successive test
runs (you will still need to wait for the cluster to be reconfigured to
the initial configuration).

`astrolabe` also provides the `--no-create` flag which makes it skip
cluster initialization if the cluster already exists. This flag may be
used to further speed up the test runs, but it can only be used for
scenarios where the cluster configuration does not change from the
initial one (otherwise the test would start with the wrong
configuration). Using `--no-delete` is recommended with `--no-create`,
otherwise each run will delete the cluster upon completion.

# Running Kubernetes Tests

Follow these instructions to run a Kubernetes container scheduling test.

## Running Tests

The `kubernetes-tests` command-group is used for Kubernetes tests. To
run a single Kubernetes test, do:

``` bash
astrolabe kubernetes-tests \
    run-one <path/to/test-file.yml> \
    --workload-file <path/to/workload-file.yml> \
    --workload-executor <path/to/workload-executor> \
    --connection-string <mongodbConnectionString>
```

where:

- `<path/to/test-file.yml>` is the absolute or relative path to a
  Kubernetes test scenario file in the `kubernetes-test-scenario`
  format,
- `<path/to/workload-file.yml>` is the absolute or relative path to a
  workload file in the `kubernetes-test-scenario` format,
- `<path/to/workload-executor>` is the absolute or relative path to the
  workload executor of the driver to be tested,
- `<mongodbConnectionString>` is the connection string

For example:

``` bash
DRIVER_DIRNAME=go \
    astrolabe kubernetes-tests \
    run-one tests/kubernetes/kind/deletePod.yml \
    --workload-file workloads/retryReads.yml \
    --workload-executor integrations/$DRIVER_DIRNAME/workload-executor \
    --connection-string "mongodb://user:12345@localhost:31181,localhost:31182,localhost:31183/admin?tls=true&tlsCertificateKeyFile=$(pwd)/mongodb_tls_cert.pem&tlsCAFile=$(pwd)/kubernetes/kind/rootCA.pem"
```
